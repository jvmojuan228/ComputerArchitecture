Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 19 IOs, 12 are locked
   and 7 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 
ERROR:Place:864 - Incompatible IOB's are locked to the same bank 34
   Conflicting IO Standards are:
   IO Standard 1: Name = LVCMOS18, VREF = NR, VCCO = 1.80, TERM = NONE, DIR =
   INPUT, DRIVE_STR = NR
   List of locked IOB's:
   	ir<0>
   	ir<1>
   	ir<2>
   	ir<3>

   IO Standard 2: Name = LVCMOS33, VREF = NR, VCCO = 3.30, TERM = NONE, DIR =
   INPUT, DRIVE_STR = NR
   List of locked IOB's:
   	id<0>
   	id<1>

   These IO Standards are incompatible due to VCCO mismatch.
